AI

- Split map up into regions (possibly re-use loot regions?)
- Each region defines AI characteristics (difficulty, what tier loot, attrition etc)
- Each region contains various entities that define activities that can be done in this area
	- A radius attribute can help randomise where things spawn (SCR_WorldTools.FindEmptyTerrainPosition)
	- A forest might have activities such as "patrol"
	- A military base might have "patrol" and "defend"
- Spawning works similar to loot
	- Players get near a region and it then:
		- checks if there's already enough AI in the region
		- if not, spawn some in at random point (but far enough away so players dont see)
		- possibly add S&D waypoint to player pos if player has high attrition impact
			- high attrition impact = you're hunted (kinda random pos around you so it's not accurate)
			- hunted pos could be interpolated based on attrition impact
				- higher impact = more accurate hunting
				- lower = barely noticeable (you'll just come across them naturally)
		- amount spawned is based on how many players in region

attrition:

- attrition governs how much the AI can achieve
- player actions can increase/decrease AI attrition
	- destroy patrol = decrease
	- die in military base (giving them your gear) = increase
- wouldn't be that complex but need good event handling on AI groups
- essentially need to know who killed who and adjust attrition based on that
- AI would have a constant base supply of attrition per hour
- AI have a max attrition level
- when AI have lowest attrition possible, it'll recover naturally based on server pop

player skills:

- similar to tarkov
- metabolism (slower metabolism, faster energy recovery etc)
- resistance to illness (unknown atm)
- stamina (thresholds for encumbrance, carry capacity, drain/s)
- weapon handling (sway, recoil, hold breath duration)
- skills don't reset to zero upon death if you die outside of dark zone
	- but you will get a debuff for a while
- skills take a lot of time to level up - some number of weeks to achieve max skills

dark zone (or something less cringe of a name)

- ultimate end game zone
- hardest AI
- best loot (doesnt spawn anywhere else)
- upon death all skills reset to zero
- option to reach a survivor camp where you have a permanent stash
	- perhaps the more attrition you take away from the AI, the bigger your stash can be
	- ^ gives the incentive to keep killing AI
	- camp is a safe zone (all weapons forced safety) for X radius around it
	- outside of that is fair game. should be a butt clench to reach the camp alive without being killed by either players or AI
	- AI avoid the camp but are obviously still in the region as a whole
